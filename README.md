# PizzaSQLProject

## Project Overview
This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to demonstrate my expertise in SQL programming and database management. The queries are crafted to address a variety of real-world data manipulation and analysis scenarios, showcasing the ability to handle data structures and produce meaningful insights.

## Part 1 – Building the SQL database
The way I’m going to approach this task of designing out database and the tables in it is to spec out all of the fields of the data we want to collect. Then I’ll go about the normalization process, adding more related tables and defining the table relationships. 

### Creating the schema

## Part 2 – Writing custom SQL queries
Writing queries that include total sales, average order value, sales by category, sales and orders by hour, calculated cost of every type of pizza and top 5 customers. 
You can find the queries here.
